# Octo.nvim Keybindings

Octo provides a comprehensive GitHub integration for Neovim, allowing you to manage pull requests, issues, and code reviews directly from your editor.

## Prerequisites

Before using Octo, you need to set up GitHub authentication:

### 1. Install GitHub CLI
```bash
# macOS
brew install gh

# Linux
curl -fsSL https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg | sudo dd of=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list > /dev/null
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gh
```

### 2. Authenticate with GitHub
```bash
gh auth login
```

### 3. Verify Setup
```bash
gh repo view  # Should show your current repository info
```

## Keybinding Types

Octo has two distinct types of keybindings:

### **Global Keybindings** (`<leader>`)
- **Scope**: Work anywhere in Neovim
- **Format**: Use `<leader>` (configured as `<Space>` in this setup)
- **Purpose**: Launch Octo functionality from any buffer

### **Buffer-Specific Keybindings** (`<space>`)
- **Scope**: Only work inside Octo buffers (PR/Issue views)
- **Format**: Use literal `<space>` (hardcoded by Octo plugin)
- **Purpose**: Interact with GitHub content (PRs, issues, comments)

> **Note**: Both use the same physical key (`Space`), but the notation differs to show context. `<leader>` = global, `<space>` = Octo buffer only.

## Global Keybindings

Access Octo from anywhere in Neovim:

| Keys | Action | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `<leader>go` | Open Octo | Open Octo main interface |
| `<leader>gpr` | List PRs | Show all pull requests |
| `<leader>gpi` | List issues | Show all issues |
| `<leader>gpc` | Create PR | Create new pull request |
| `<leader>gic` | Create issue | Create new issue |

## Pull Request Management

| `:Octo pr search <query>` | Search PRs with specific criteria |
| `:Octo pr edit <number>` | Edit specific PR |
| `:Octo pr create` | Create new PR |

|-----|--------|-------------|
| `]c` | Next comment | Jump to next comment |
| `[c` | Previous comment | Jump to previous comment |
| `]q` | Next changed file | Navigate to next file |
| `[q` | Previous changed file | Navigate to previous file |
| `gf` | Go to file | Open file under cursor |

#### PR Actions
| Key | Action | Description |
|-----|--------|-------------|
| `<space>po` | Checkout PR | Checkout PR branch locally |
| `<space>pm` | Merge PR | Merge PR (commit merge) |
| `<space>psm` | Squash and merge | Squash and merge PR |

| `<space>pd` | Show diff | Show PR diff |
| `<space>pl` | List PRs | List all PRs |

#### PR Merge Commands

Octo provides comprehensive merge commands that respect your configuration defaults and allow fine-grained control:

##### Basic Merge Commands

**Note**: These commands work on the currently opened PR (via `:Octo pr edit <number>`)

| Command | Description | Default Behavior |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| `:Octo pr merge` | Merge current PR using default method | Uses `default_merge_method` config |
| `:Octo pr merge commit` | Standard merge commit | Creates a merge commit |
| `:Octo pr merge squash` | Squash and merge | Combines commits into one |
| `:Octo pr merge rebase` | Rebase and merge | Rebases commits onto base branch |

##### Branch Deletion Options

You can control branch deletion by adding arguments:

| Command Example | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| `:Octo pr merge delete` | Force delete branch after merge |
| `:Octo pr merge nodelete` | Keep branch after merge |
| `:Octo pr merge squash delete` | Squash merge and delete branch |
| `:Octo pr merge rebase nodelete` | Rebase merge and keep branch |

Without specifying `delete` or `nodelete`, the command uses your `default_delete_branch` configuration.

##### Admin Merge Commands (Custom)

For repositories with branch protection, use admin privileges. Unlike the basic commands, these require a PR number since they use the GitHub CLI directly:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `:Octo pr merge_admin <PR>` | Admin merge with defaults |
| `:Octo pr merge_admin <PR> squash` | Admin squash merge |
| `:Octo pr merge_admin <PR> rebase` | Admin rebase merge |
| `:Octo pr merge_admin <PR> commit` | Admin standard merge |
| `:Octo pr merge_admin <PR> squash delete` | Admin squash merge and delete |
| `:Octo pr merge_admin <PR> nodelete` | Admin merge and keep branch |

Examples:
- `:Octo pr merge_admin 42` - Merge PR #42 with admin privileges using defaults
- `:Octo pr merge_admin 42 squash delete` - Squash merge PR #42 and delete branch
- `:Octo pr merge_admin` - Will prompt for PR number if not provided

##### Configuration Defaults

The merge behavior is controlled by these settings in your Octo config:
- `default_merge_method`: "commit" | "squash" | "rebase" (default: "commit")
- `default_delete_branch`: true | false (default: false)

## Workflow Integration

### Complete Git ‚Üí GitHub Flow

1. **Local Development**:
   - Use `gitsigns` for local changes
   - Use `neogit` for git operations
   - Use `diffview` for detailed diffs

2. **Create PR**:
   - `<leader>gpc` to create PR from current branch
   - Or `:Octo pr create` for more options

3. **Review Process**:
   - `<leader>gpr` to list PRs
   - Select PR and use review keybindings
   - Add comments, suggestions, reactions

4. **Merge**:
   - `<space>pm` to merge PR
   - Or `<space>psm` to squash and merge

### Issue Management Flow

1. **List Issues**: `<leader>gpi`
2. **Create Issue**: `<leader>gic`
3. **Manage**: Use issue keybindings for labels, assignees, comments
4. **Close**: `<space>ic` when resolved

## Configuration Notes

### Authentication
- Uses GitHub CLI (`gh`) for authentication
- Respects `gh` configuration and tokens
- Works with GitHub Enterprise if configured in `gh`

### Remotes
- Checks `upstream` remote first, then `origin`
- Configurable via `default_remote` setting
- Supports SSH aliases

### Performance
- Lazy loads on first `:Octo` command
- Caches data to reduce API calls
- Timeout configurable (default: 5 seconds)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Error**:
   ```bash
   gh auth status  # Check authentication
   gh auth refresh  # Refresh token
   ```

2. **API Rate Limits**:
   - GitHub API has rate limits
   - Authenticated requests have higher limits
   - Wait or use personal access token

3. **Repository Not Found**:
   - Ensure you're in a git repository
   - Check remote configuration: `git remote -v`
   - Verify GitHub repository exists

4. **Keybinding Conflicts**:
   - Octo keybindings are buffer-specific
   - Only active in Octo buffers
   - Check `:map` for conflicts

### Debug Information

```
:Octo actions         " Show available actions
:checkhealth octo     " Check plugin health
:lua print(vim.inspect(require('octo.config').get_config()))  " Show config
```

## Tips

1. **Use with Neogit**: Perfect complement to local git operations
2. **Telescope Integration**: Fuzzy find PRs and issues efficiently  
3. **Review Workflow**: Use review mode for thorough code reviews
4. **Reactions**: Quick way to acknowledge comments without lengthy replies
5. **Draft PRs**: Use draft PRs for work-in-progress sharing
