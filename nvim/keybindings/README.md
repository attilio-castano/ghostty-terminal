# Detailed Keybinding Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive keybinding documentation for plugins with complex internal mappings.

## Quick Links

- [Diffview](./diffview.md) - Git diff viewer with VS Code-like interface
- More coming soon...

## Why Separate Documentation?

Some plugins (like diffview, telescope, nvim-tree) have extensive keybindings that only work within their specific contexts. To keep the main `KEYBINDINGS.md` concise and readable, we've moved detailed plugin-specific bindings here.

## Structure

Each file documents:
- When the keybindings are active
- Complete list of available mappings
- Tips and common workflows
- Integration with other plugins
